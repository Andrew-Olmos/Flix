### Notes
The main issue with part 2 of Flix would be "clipping" of text and images from the right hand side, this is an issue for any generation of iPhones. Even though I am submitting this assignment I am hoping to find a solution to this issue.

### Notes
I've never used swift or xcode before so learning a new language and software while also developing has been a challenge in the sense that there's a lot of information to process. My curious has definitely been satisfied and I've been enjoying the journey in learning these new skills so far.
